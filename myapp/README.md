# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### FAQ:-
1.How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Ans: As React is open-sourceand the most popular Front end Javascript Library for building user interface or UI components. It provides reauability of components. Its architecture is easy to understand because of components. That's why I decided to choose React as my Front end library for this Assignment.

2.Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Ans: Yes there is nothing all perfect. This UI need of some improvements . We can connect database for data and get the data by queirs. Also Depoly on Heroku.

3.What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Ans:If alloted more time i would definitely make a backend using node.js for this Front end where i can just hanlde different routes for login and movies and series page and sending details of the movies and series as per the user interests.
